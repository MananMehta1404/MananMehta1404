## Projects

### Blog App
A blog application created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Graph CMS as the Content Management System. It allows the bloggers to add posts dynamically without writing a single line of code. When readers do comments on the blog the comments will be submitted for review and once they are reviewed the comments are displayed in the comments section of the respective blog.
